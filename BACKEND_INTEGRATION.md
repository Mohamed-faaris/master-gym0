## Seeding the Database

To populate your database with sample data:

### Method 1: Via Convex Dashboard

1. Go to your Convex dashboard
2. Navigate to "Functions"
3. Find and run `seed:seedDatabase`
4. The database will be populated with sample users, plans, logs, etc.

### Method 2: Via Code

```typescript
import { useMutation } from 'convex/react'
import { api } from '../convex/_generated/api'

function SeedButton() {
  const seedDatabase = useMutation(api.seed.seedDatabase)

  return (
    <button onClick={() => seedDatabase()}>
      Seed Database
    </button>
  )
}
```

## Sample Users Created by Seed Script

After running the seed script, you can log in with these accounts:

1. **Admin**
   - Phone: `1000000000`
   - PIN: `000000`
   - Role: Admin

2. **Trainer**
   - Phone: `1111111111`
   - PIN: `111111`
   - Role: Trainer

3. **Client 1 (Sarah Johnson)**
   - Phone: `2222222222`
   - PIN: `222222`
   - Role: Trainer Managed Customer
   - Goal: Weight Loss

4. **Client 2 (Mike Chen)**
   - Phone: `3333333333`
   - PIN: `333333`
   - Role: Trainer Managed Customer
   - Goal: Muscle Gain

5. **Client 3 (Emma Davis)**
   - Phone: `4444444444`
   - PIN: `444444`
   - Role: Self Managed Customer
   - Goal: Endurance

## Sample Data Included

- 4 users with complete profiles
- 2 training plans (Strength Training & Cardio/Endurance)
- 2 diet plans (Weight Loss & Muscle Building)
- 2 completed workout logs with exercises
- 4 diet logs (meals logged today)
- 10 weight logs (tracking progress over 30 days)

## Development Workflow

### 1. Start Convex Dev Server

```bash
npx convex dev
```

### 2. Seed the Database

Once Convex is running, seed the database through the dashboard or programmatically.

### 3. Start Your App

```bash
npm run dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

### 4. Test Authentication

Try logging in with any of the sample user credentials above.

## Clearing the Database

If you need to reset the database:

```typescript
const clearDatabase = useMutation(api.seed.clearDatabase)

// Call it
await clearDatabase()
```

**WARNING**: This will delete ALL data from ALL tables. Use only in development!

## Integration Examples

### Example: Get User's Workout Stats

```typescript
import { useQuery } from 'convex/react'
import { api } from '../convex/_generated/api'

function WorkoutStatsComponent({ userId }) {
  const stats = useQuery(api.workoutLogs.getWorkoutStats, { userId })

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Total Workouts: {stats?.totalWorkouts}</p>
      <p>Completed: {stats?.completedWorkouts}</p>
      <p>Total Duration: {stats?.totalDuration} min</p>
      <p>Calories Burned: {stats?.totalCalories}</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Example: Start a Workout

```typescript
import { useMutation } from 'convex/react'
import { api } from '../convex/_generated/api'

function StartWorkoutButton({ userId }) {
  const createWorkout = useMutation(api.workoutLogs.createWorkoutLog)

  const handleStart = async () => {
    const workoutId = await createWorkout({
      userId,
      workoutType: 'strength'
    })
    console.log('Workout started:', workoutId)
  }

  return <button onClick={handleStart}>Start Workout</button>
}
```

### Example: Log a Meal

```typescript
import { useMutation } from 'convex/react'
import { api } from '../convex/_generated/api'

function LogMealButton({ userId }) {
  const addDietLog = useMutation(api.dietLogs.addDietLog)

  const handleLogMeal = async () => {
    await addDietLog({
      userId,
      mealType: 'breakfast',
      title: 'Oatmeal Bowl',
      description: 'Oats with berries and honey',
      calories: 350
    })
  }

  return <button onClick={handleLogMeal}>Log Meal</button>
}
```

## Next Steps

1. Run the seed script to populate your database
2. Test authentication with sample users
3. Explore the management dashboard with trainer/admin accounts
4. Test client features with customer accounts
5. Build out additional UI components using the backend functions

## Notes

- All timestamps are stored as Unix timestamps (milliseconds)
- Phone numbers are used as unique identifiers for authentication
- PINs are 6-digit strings (stored in plain text - for demo purposes only!)
- Trainer-managed customers are linked to their trainers
- Training plans can be assigned to multiple users
- Diet plans are templates that users can follow
